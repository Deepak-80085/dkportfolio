# Project Overview

This portfolio website is built using **React** and **Vite**.  
- **React** was chosen for its component-based architecture, allowing for reusable UI elements and a smooth development experience.
- **Vite** serves as the build tool and development server, providing lightning-fast hot module replacement and optimized production builds. Vite's modern approach made the development process efficient and enjoyable.

## Key Technologies Used

- **React**: For building interactive user interfaces.
- **Vite**: For fast development and optimized builds.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better code maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid and responsive UI styling.
- **shadcn-ui**: For beautiful, accessible UI components.
